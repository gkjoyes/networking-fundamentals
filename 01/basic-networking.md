# Basic Networking

## What is networking?

- A network is created when you have two or more hosts connected together so that they can communicate and share resources.

- A host can be any device that has a **network interface** which allows it to connect to other devices on a network.

- Some example of resources which can be shared is documents and printers.

## Different Types of Networks

- **Client/Server**: In a client/server network each host will act specifically as a server(the provider of resources) or a client (the receiver of resources).

- **Peer-to-Peer**: In a peer-to-peer network, every host will act as both a client and a server.

- **LAN - Local Area Network**: Typically refers to a network contained within a building.

- **CAN - Campus Area Network**: A network spread between multiple contiguous buildings.

- **MAN - Metropolitan Area Network**: A network spread between multiple non-contiguous building within a single metropolitan area.

- **WAN- Wide Area Network**: A network spread over a wide area, typically covering multiple cities and countries.

## How do we make connections?

- Network hosts communicate with each other by sending bits of information across network media.

- Network media can be wired or wireless.

- Examples of wire media are copper and optical fiber.

- Example of wireless media is RF and infrared.

## What is a protocol?

- The definition of a protocol is a set of rules and procedures for communication.

- In order for hosts to communicate on a network. They much agree to use a common set of rules and procedures or in other words must use the same network protocol.

- One of the most commonly used network protocol is TCP/IP.

## Introduction to IP Addressing

- All hosts on a network must be identified with an address on that network.

- Addressing in a computer network is similar to how addressing works with the postal network or telephone network.

- There are both private and public forms of addressing.

- Private addressing is used to keep communication safe within the boundaries of a private secure network.

- Public addressing is used to allow communications with the outside world, most typically known as the internet.
